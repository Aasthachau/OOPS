        "\n",
        "1. The Core Concept\n",
        "Inheritance establishes a hierarchical, parent-child relationship between classes:\n",
        "\n",
        "Parent Class (Base Class or Superclass): The existing class whose features are being inherited.\n",

        "Child Class (Derived Class or Subclass): The new class that inherits features from the parent class.\n",

        "\n",
        "Example: A Dog is a type of Animal. A Sedan is a type of Car.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Benefits and Purpose\n",
        "The primary reasons for using inheritance are:\n",
        "\n",
        "Code Reusability: The child class automatically gets all the non-private attributes and methods of the parent class, meaning you don't have to write the same code twice.\n",
        "\n",
        "Polymorphism: Inheritance is essential for implementing polymorphism, allowing a single method name to be used across different classes in the hierarchy.\n",
        "\n",
        "Logical Organization: It helps organize classes into a clear, intuitive hierarchy that models the real-world domain.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. How Inheritance Works\n",
        "Consider the relationship between an Animal class and a Dog class:\n",
        "\n",
        "Animal Class (Superclass): Defines common attributes (age, color) and methods (eat(), sleep()).\n",
        "\n",
        "Dog Class (Subclass):\n",
        "\n",
        "It inherits the age, color, eat(), and sleep() features automatically.\n",
        "\n",
        "It adds new, specific features that only dogs have, such as the breed attribute and the bark() method.\n",
        "\n",
        "This means you only define the eat() method once in the Animal class, and every class that inherits from Animal (like Dog, Cat, Bird) can use it without any extra code.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Method Overriding\n",
        "A child class can also override a method inherited from the parent class. This means the child class provides its own specific implementation for a method that is already defined in the parent.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: Both Dog and Cat inherit the make_sound() method from Animal. However, the Dog class can override it to print \"Woof,\" and the Cat class can override it to print \"Meow.\" The method name is the same, but the behavior is specific to the object type."

        "The most important point is that Python does not support method overloading in the traditional sense.\n",

        "\n",
        "Default Arguments: By giving some parameters a default value (like None), you make those arguments optional. The single method can then handle different numbers of arguments (e.g., calling it with two arguments or three arguments).\n",

        "Type Checking: Inside the single method, you can use conditional logic (if/elif/else) and functions like isinstance() to check the type of the received arguments. The method's behavior can then change based on the data type it receives.\n"

        "ANSWER: Method Overriding is a key feature of Runtime Polymorphism in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It allows a subclass (child class) to provide a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass (parent class).\n",

        "\n",
        "1. The Core Principle\n",
        "Method overriding works exclusively within an Inheritance hierarchy.\n",

        "(A)Inheritance: A Subclass inherits a method (e.g., move()) from its Superclass.\n",
        "\n",
        "(B)Definition: The Superclass provides a general implementation for move() (e.g., \"Generic movement\").\n",
        "\n",
        "(C)Overriding: The Subclass then redefines the same move() method.\n",
        "\n",
        "(D)Runtime Decision: When the method is called on an object of the subclass, the subclass's version of the method is executed, effectively replacing the superclass's version for that specific object.\n",

        "ANSWER--> Polymorphism in Python with Inheritance\n",
        "1. Meaning of Polymorphism:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Polymorphism means “many forms”.\n",
        "\n",
        "- In Python, polymorphism allows the same method name to behave differently for different objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Polymorphism using Inheritance:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Polymorphism works when a child class inherits from a parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "- The child class can override (redefine) a method of the parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "- When the same method is called, Python decides which method to run at runtime.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Method Overriding (Main Concept):\n",
        "\n",
        "- A child class can provide its own implementation of a parent class method.\n",
        "\n",
        "- The method name and parameters remain same.\n",
        "\n",
        "- The object type decides which method will be executed.\n",

        "- This is called runtime polymorphism.\n",

        "4. Role of Parent Class Reference:\n",
        "\n",
        "- A parent class reference can point to a child class object.\n",
        "\n",
        "- When a method is called using this reference:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Python executes the child class method, not the parent one.\n",
        "\n",
        "- This shows dynamic method binding.\n",

        "\n",
        "- In method chaining, a method returns:\n",

        "\n",
        "- another object that supports the next method.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Because of this return value, methods can be linked one after another.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Key Requirement\n",
        "\n",
        "- Each method must return self (or a valid object).\n",
        "\n",

        "- Reduces number of lines of code\n",
        "\n",
        "- Improves code readability\n",
        "\n",
        "- Makes code look fluent and object-oriented\n",

        "- Methods belong to the same class.\n",
        "\n",
        "- All chained methods operate on the same object.\n",
